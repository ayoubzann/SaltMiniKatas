Welcome to your first assignment as a mob!

1. Run `dotnet test`.
2. Inspect the failing tests.
3. Write your solutions in the `Solutions.cs` file.
4. Refactor and repeat.

Pro tip: you can run `dotnet watch test` to have the tests run on every save change.

We have set up a boilerplate for you so that you have a starting point.

GLHF!
